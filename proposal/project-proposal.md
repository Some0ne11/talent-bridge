# **Executive Summary**

1) **Brief Description**  
   TalentBridge is designed to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia across various industries. Many SMEs face challenges in managing recruitment efficiently due to limited resources and budgets. TalentBridge aims to streamline recruitment efforts by consolidating job postings, applications, and job seeker profiles into a single, manageable database system. This solution enables HR managers and employers to post job listings, review candidate profiles, and manage applications, with an admin (us) overseeing the application tracking to ensure consistency and support across all SMEs on the platform.  
     
2) **Current System and its Problem**  
   Currently, many SMEs rely on manual processes (e.g., spreadsheets, email) to handle recruitment, resulting in disorganised records, missed follow-ups, and inefficient workflows. This lack of a structured system makes it difficult for smaller HR teams to maintain an effective hiring process, which reduces their capacity to attract and evaluate suitable candidates efficiently. The absence of a centralised database also limits the ability to track recruitment progress or generate insightful reports, adding to the administrative burden on HR staff and increasing time to hire.  
     
3) **Project Scope**  
   TalentBridge will provide a recruitment management system tailored specifically for SMEs, consolidating essential hiring functions into a single database. The platform will feature modules for **job listings**, **job seeker profiles**, **application tracking**, and **company profiles**, enabling efficient record management, report generation, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The **Application Tracking Module** will serve as an admin tool, overseeing the application process to maintain consistency and support for multiple SMEs using the platform. By automating repetitive tasks and creating a unified recruitment system, TalentBridge will enhance productivity, reduce administrative load, and support the sustainable growth of SMEs in Malaysia.

# **Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)**

   This project aligns with **SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth**, which promotes inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment, and decent work for all. By offering a recruitment management solution that simplifies hiring and supports efficient recruitment, TalentBridge helps SMEs in Malaysia strengthen their operational capacity. The platform’s centralised, automated approach allows smaller companies to attract and retain skilled employees without significant resources. Ultimately, this system will empower SMEs to hire more effectively, reduce hiring costs, and contribute to economic growth through job creation, fulfilling their critical role in Malaysia’s economy.

# **Modules to be Implemented**

1. **Job Listing Module (Ammar Danial)**  
   **Description:** This module is a central feature of the TalentBridge system, allowing employers to create, manage, and optimise job postings effectively. It provides employers with the tools to input comprehensive details about job vacancies, including titles, descriptions, required qualifications, skills, salary ranges, and application deadlines. Employers can categorise job postings by type (e.g., full-time, part-time, internship) and sector (e.g., IT, finance, marketing), making it easier for job seekers to navigate the listings. Additionally, employers have the flexibility to edit existing job postings and remove listings that are no longer available. This module enhances visibility and organisation in the recruitment process.  
     
2. **Job Seeker Profile Module (Hurin Damia)**  
   **Description:** This module focuses on managing the profiles of job seekers, offering a user-friendly interface for them to present their qualifications and experiences. Job seekers can create profiles that include personal information, contact details, educational backgrounds, and career aspirations. The module allows users to upload and manage their resumes easily and catalogue their skills, certifications, and work experiences. It also provides functionality for job seekers to know about new job postings that align with their skills and preferences, ensuring they are informed about relevant opportunities.  
     
3. **Application Tracking Module (Ahmad Adib)**  
   **Description:** This module serves as a crucial admin tool and "middleman" between job seekers and recruiters, enabling the monitoring of job application statuses submitted by candidates. It enhances transparency and organisation within the recruitment process. Job seekers can conveniently check the status of their applications, providing them with clarity throughout the hiring journey. The module maintains a history of applications, allowing users to view the jobs they have applied for along with corresponding status updates. Furthermore, employers can offer constructive feedback on applications, helping candidates gain valuable insights from their experiences.   
     
4. **Company Profile Module (Abdul Arif)**  
   **Description:** This module enables companies to create and maintain detailed profiles that showcase their brand identity and organisational culture to prospective job seekers. Companies can provide essential details such as their name, location, industry focus, and size. This module includes an overview of all current job postings from the company, allowing potential candidates to see opportunities in one place. Companies can enhance their profiles with logos, mission statements, descriptions, and links to their websites or social media profiles. The module can also feature a section for employee testimonials or success stories, adding a personal touch that can attract job seekers.
